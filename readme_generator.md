@Codebase Now that we have audited the code, I need to generate a "Gold Standard" README.md. Please analyze the repository structure, dependency files, and main logic entries to construct a README that includes:

1.  **The "Elevator Pitch":** A clear, 2-sentence description of what this project solves.
2.  **Inferred Features:** Scan the function names and classes to list the top 3-5 core features.
3.  **Installation & Usage:** Look at my dependency files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt, cargo.toml) and write the exact commands a user needs to install and run this.
4.  **"Quick Start" Example:** Find a simple usage example in the code (or tests) and format it as a code block so a new user can copy-paste it to test the library immediately.
5.  **Tech Stack:** List the primary languages and frameworks used.

**Style Requirement:** Use professional Markdown formatting with badges (Shields.io) at the top for License and Language. If the architecture is complex, generate a Mermaid.js flowchart describing the data flow.
