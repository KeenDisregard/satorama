@Codebase I want to create a `CHANGELOG.md` to establish a history for Version 1.0.0. 

Since the git history is messy, please scan the code features as they exist *right now* and summarize them into a "Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release" entry. Group the features logically (e.g., "Core Logic," "UI Components," "Utilities").
