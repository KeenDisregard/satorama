@Codebase I am ready to open this up to contributors. Please generate two files: `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

**For the CONTRIBUTING.md:**
1.  **Analyze my current coding style:** Look at how I name variables, how I comment code, and my directory structure. Summarize this into a brief "Style Guide" for new contributors so their PRs match my style.
2.  **Workflow:** specific instructions on how to fork, clone, and submit a Pull Request.
3.  **Testing:** Look for any test folders or test scripts in the repo. Write instructions on how a contributor should run these tests before submitting code.

**For the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:**
1.  Use the standard "Contributor Covenant" template (v2.1), but adapt it to be friendly and encouraging for a smaller project.
