# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being welcoming and friendly** — especially to newcomers
- **Using inclusive language** — avoid jargon when possible, explain when necessary
- **Being respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Focusing on what's best** for the community and project
- **Showing empathy** toward other community members
- **Assuming good intent** — most misunderstandings aren't malicious

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other project-related communication channels.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation or a single severe incident such as harassment or aggression.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project.

## A Note on This Project

This project aims to become a reliable, production-ready tool for satellite visualization — useful for educational demos, mission planning, and operational awareness. We welcome contributors of all skill levels who share this vision.

Please be patient with response times and kind to fellow contributors as we build something great together.

**We're excited to have you here!** 🛰️
